## 🌟 Overview

**wavetrack-relayer** provides production-grade infrastructure for the Stellar ecosystem, engineered for high availability, fault-tolerant execution, and strict architectural invariant guarantees. It delivers sub-second transaction routing, robust telemetry streaming, and automated execution rails tailored for high-volume Web3 applications.

---

## 🏗️ Core Architecture & Features

- **Decentralized Execution**: Autonomous smart contracts and backend services integrated with Stellar Horizon and Soroban RPC.
- **Invariant Guarantees**: Core state machines formally validated with property-based testing and fuzzing harnesses.
- **High-Throughput Settlement**: Optimized transaction batching, event streaming, and sub-second state reconciliation.
- **Granular Security Controls**: Cryptographic Ed25519 signature verification, replay guards, and bounded storage layouts.
- **Enterprise Telemetry**: Distributed OpenTelemetry tracing spans, Prometheus metrics, and structured log emissions for real-time visibility.
